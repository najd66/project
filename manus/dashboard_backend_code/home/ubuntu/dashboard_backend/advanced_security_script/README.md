# Advanced Security Script - README

## 1. Overview

This Advanced Security Script is a comprehensive, modular, and extensible framework designed for sophisticated cybersecurity analysis, automated vulnerability detection, intelligent reporting, and adaptive exploitation. It integrates cutting-edge technologies including Large Language Models (LLM) with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), Reinforcement Learning (RL) for adaptive testing, adversarial defense mechanisms for its AI components, and proactive vulnerability intelligence gathering.

The script is built with a universal and scalable architecture, allowing for easy addition of new modules and adaptation to various security testing scenarios. Its core philosophy is to provide a powerful, automated, and intelligent assistant for security professionals and researchers.

## 2. Architecture

The script follows a modular architecture, detailed in `docs/architecture_design.md`. Key components include:

-   **Core Layer:** Manages configuration, logging, AI model lifecycle (MLOps Lite), workflow orchestration, and data/artifact handling.
    -   `ConfigManager`: Loads and provides access to configuration settings from YAML files.
    -   `LoggerManager`: Sets up and manages structured logging (text or JSON) across all modules.
    -   `WorkflowOrchestrator`: Coordinates the execution of tasks and sequences of module operations.
    -   `ModelManager` (Conceptual): Manages loading and versioning of ML models.
    -   `DataManager` (Conceptual): Manages input/output data and knowledge bases.
-   **Functional Modules Layer:** Contains individual modules for specific tasks:
    -   **Intelligence & Reconnaissance:** UI analysis, audio analysis, tech stack detection, endpoint enumeration, and a proactive `VulnerabilityCrawler`.
    -   **Vulnerability Analysis:** Static code analysis (DistilBert), network analysis (GNN), patch analysis.
    -   **Exploitation & Pen-testing:** AI-driven payload generation (Conditional GANs), WAF bypassing, various exploit modules (Parameter Tampering, GraphQL, WebSocket, SOAP, Business Logic), and an `RLAgent` for adaptive exploitation.
    -   **AI Security & Defense:** `AdversarialTester` for evaluating ML model robustness and `AdversarialDefender` (conceptual) for implementing defenses.
    -   **Reporting & Notification:** `LLMReportGenerator` for creating rich, contextual reports using LLM+RAG, and a `SmartNotifier` (conceptual) for intelligent alerts.
-   **Interface Layer:** Currently CLI-focused, with potential for future API exposure.

## 3. Features

-   **Modular Design:** Easily extendable and maintainable.
-   **Centralized Configuration:** Manage all script and module settings via YAML files.
-   **Structured Logging:** Comprehensive logging for debugging and auditing (supports JSON format).
-   **AI-Powered Analysis:**
    -   LLM+RAG for intelligent vulnerability contextualization and report generation.
    -   Reinforcement Learning for adaptive security testing and payload optimization.
    -   Deep Learning models for code analysis, UI analysis, and audio transcription.
-   **Proactive Vulnerability Intelligence:** Automated crawling of NVD, Exploit-DB, etc., for the latest threats.
-   **Adversarial Robustness (Planned):** Testing and defense mechanisms for internal AI models.
-   **Automated Workflow Orchestration:** Define and run complex security assessment workflows.

## 5. Prerequisites

-   Python 3.9+ (Recommended)
-   `pip` for installing dependencies.
-   Specific dependencies will be listed in `requirements.txt`. Key libraries include PyYAML, PyTorch, Transformers, AIOHTTP, python-json-logger. For advanced features, libraries like Stable Baselines3 (for RL) and ART (Adversarial Robustness Toolbox) will be needed.

## 6. Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable) or ensure all files are in the correct structure.**

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    A `requirements.txt` will be provided. Install using:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: `requirements.txt` needs to be generated based on all imported libraries across modules.)*

4.  **Configuration:**
    -   Copy or rename a sample configuration file (e.g., `configs/default_config.yaml.example`) to `configs/default_config.yaml`.
    -   Edit `configs/default_config.yaml` to set API keys (e.g., for LLM services), paths, and other parameters as needed.

## 7. Usage

*(This section will be expanded as `main.py` and CLI interactions are fully developed.)*

The script will be run via a main entry point, likely `main.py`.

**Example (Conceptual):**
```bash
python main.py --task full_scan --target_url http://example.com
python main.py --task crawl_vulnerabilities --keywords "Apache Struts"
```

-   The `WorkflowOrchestrator` will manage the execution based on the task specified.
-   Logs will be generated in the `logs/` directory.
-   Reports (e.g., from `LLMReportGenerator`) will be saved to the `data/outputs/` directory or displayed.

## 8. Configuration

Configuration is managed via YAML files in the `configs/` directory. The primary configuration file is `default_config.yaml`.

**Key Configuration Sections (Example):**

-   `global`:
    -   `log_level`: Logging verbosity (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR).
    -   `log_file_path`: Path to the main log file.
    -   `json_log_format`: Boolean, true to output logs in JSON format.
-   `llm_report_generator`:
    -   `model_name`: Identifier for the LLM to be used.
    -   `api_key_env`: Environment variable name holding the API key for the LLM service.
    -   Parameters for RAG (e.g., knowledge base path, retriever settings).
-   `vulnerability_crawler`:
    -   API URLs or RSS feed URLs for sources like NVD, Exploit-DB.
    -   `max_results_per_source`.
-   `rl_agent`:
    -   Paths to pre-trained RL models or training parameters.
    -   Environment settings for security testing.
-   **Module-specific configurations.**

Refer to `docs/user_manual.md` for more detailed configuration options.

## 9. Running Tests

Unit tests are located in the `tests/unit/` directory. Integration tests will be in `tests/integration/`.

To run tests (e.g., using `unittest` or `pytest`):
```bash
# Using unittest from the project root
python -m unittest discover -s tests/unit

# Or if using pytest (after installing pytest)
# pytest
```
